    <p>OpenBazaar is a new way to buy and sell goods and services online for free using Bitcoin. This free ecommerce system, currently being overseen by the company OB1, uses a decentralized p2p (or peer to peer) network where users connect directly to one another to buy and sell with no central company to charge fees or censor exchanges. The vision for this open source ecommerce platform is to produce a community-driven software that facilitates easy Bitcoin transactions and brings to life the more secure, decentralized network model of the future.</p>
